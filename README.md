# To-Do List Manager

The **To-Do List Manager** is a graphical Java application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks.
With features like task prioritization, and an intuitive user interface, this project is inspired by the need for better time management tools in daily life. This project draws inspiration from popular productivity apps like Todoist and Microsoft To-Do while being tailored for simplicity and ease of use. It was initially designed to fulfill academic requirements and evolved into a proof-of-concept application showcasing object-oriented programming principles.
